# SlopeMovement
This program takes the large amount of mining wall slope data within the excel file, corrects and graphs it.
The readings were taken from an instrument locaed at a mine. The instrument recorded the date, X coordinates, Y coordinates, and Z coordinates as well as the slope distance.
Some of the data had to be corrected due to instrumentaion errors, as seen in program with the dfDataresampled. Used in the program are the pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, datetime, and numpy libraries. Pandas was used to access the excel sheet, matplotlib.pyplot was used in the plotting of the data, datetime was used to deal with the dates within the excel sheet.
